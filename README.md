The code is messy and uses an incorrect architecture. Relying on `useState`-reactive-UI introduces some performance problems that have not been resolved.
This will be fixed when (if) I revisit this project.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
